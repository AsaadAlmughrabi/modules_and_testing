## Modules and testing


**This Python code provides functions to calculate factorials and clumsy factorials.**

- **Factorial:** Calculates the product of all positive integers less than or equal to the input number (n!). It offers both iterative and recursive approaches.
- **Clumsy Factorial:**  it uses a cyclic pattern of multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction on the input number and remaining numbers down to 1.

**The code also includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the calculations.**
